# Jenkins Master & Agents: using GKE to deploy Jenkins on Google Cloud.

For a more in depth best practices guide, go to the solution posted [here](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/jenkins-on-container-engine).

## Prerequisites
1. A Google Cloud Platform Account
1. [Enable the Compute Engine, Container Engine, and Container Builder APIs](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=compute_component,container,cloudbuild.googleapis.com)
2. Install gcloud - https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts
3. Install kubectl - https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/
4. Install helm - https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/


## Create cluster, deploy and install Jenkins.
You'll use Google Container Engine to create and manage your Kubernetes cluster. Provision the cluster with `gcloud`:

```shell
./deploy-jenkins-k8s.sh
```

## Configure and use Jenkins

1. Run the following command to setup port forwarding to the Jenkins UI from the Cloud Shell

    ```shell
    export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -l "app.kubernetes.io/component=jenkins-master" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
    kubectl port-forward $POD_NAME 8080:8080 >> /dev/null &
    ```

1. Now, check that the Jenkins Service was created properly:

    ```shell
    $ kubectl get svc
    NAME               CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)     AGE
    cd-jenkins         10.35.249.67   <none>        8080/TCP    3h
    cd-jenkins-agent   10.35.248.1    <none>        50000/TCP   3h
    kubernetes         10.35.240.1    <none>        443/TCP     9h
    ```

We are using the [Kubernetes Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Kubernetes+Plugin) so that our builder nodes will be automatically launched as necessary when the Jenkins master requests them.
Upon completion of their work they will automatically be turned down and their resources added back to the clusters resource pool.

Notice that this service exposes ports `8080` and `50000` for any pods that match the `selector`. This will expose the Jenkins web UI and builder/agent registration ports within the Kubernetes cluster.
Additionally the `jenkins-ui` services is exposed using a ClusterIP so that it is not accessible from outside the cluster.


## Connect to Jenkins

1. The Jenkins chart will automatically create an admin password for you. To retrieve it, run:

    ```shell
    printf $(kubectl get secret cd-jenkins -o jsonpath="{.data.jenkins-admin-password}" | base64 --decode);echo
    ```

2. To get to the Jenkins user interface, click on the Web Preview button![](../docs/img/web-preview.png) in cloud shell, then click “Preview on port 8080”:

You should now be able to log in with username `admin` and your auto generated password.

### Your progress, and what's next
You've got a Kubernetes cluster managed by Google Container Engine. You've deployed:

* a Jenkins Deployment
* a (non-public) service that exposes Jenkins to its agent containers

You have the tools to build a continuous deployment pipeline. Now you need a sample app to deploy continuously.


## Clean up
Clean up is really easy, but also super important: if you don't follow these instructions, you will continue to be billed for the Google Container Engine cluster you created.

To clean up, navigate to the [Google Developers Console Project List](https://console.developers.google.com/project), choose the project you created for this lab, and delete it. That's it.
